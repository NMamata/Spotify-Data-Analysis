🎵 Spotify Data Analysis – Python Project
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing Spotify music dataset using Python. The aim is to uncover insights related to track popularity, audio features, artist performance, genre trends, and correlations between song characteristics. The project includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualizations, feature engineering, and result interpretation.

This repository contains:
✔ Python Notebook (.ipynb)
✔ Data Preprocessing & Cleaning Steps
✔ Graphical Insights using Matplotlib & Seaborn
✔ Feature Correlation Analysis
✔ Summary Report of Findings

🗂 Dataset Information

The dataset contains Spotify track-level music metadata, including:

Feature	Description
Track Name	Name of the song
Artist	Performing artist
Popularity	Popularity score (0–100)
Duration_ms	Duration of the track in milliseconds
Danceability	Ability to dance to the song
Energy	Song intensity
Loudness	dB loudness measure
Speechiness	Spoken word content
Acousticness	Acoustic sound measure
Instrumentalness	Instrumental ratio
Liveness	Live audience presence
Valence	Positive mood measure
Tempo	Beats per minute (BPM)
🏗️ Project Workflow
1️⃣ Importing Libraries

pandas, numpy (data processing)

matplotlib, seaborn (visualization)

sklearn (optional – for clustering or trend patterns)

2️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preparation

Checking missing values

Handling duplicates

Feature formatting (duration conversion)

Univariate & multivariate EDA

3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis

Some example questions explored:

Which songs or artists are the most popular?

Which audio feature most strongly impacts popularity?

What genres dominate Spotify dataset?

Relationship between danceability, energy & tempo

Mood-based cluster analysis using valence & energy

4️⃣ Visualization Outputs

The project includes:
📊 Popularity distribution
📊 Top artists with highest popularity
📊 Correlation heatmap of audio features
📊 Scatterplots – tempo vs danceability, valence vs energy
📊 Histogram & boxplots for audio features

📈 Key Insights & Analysis Summary

🔹 Popularity Concentration – Most tracks fall in medium popularity range
🔹 High Danceability & Energy Songs tend to be more popular
🔹 Tempo (BPM) has weaker effect on popularity
🔹 Valence (Happiness score) helps group songs into mood categories
🔹 Top Artists – dataset highlights that few artists dominate the charts
🔹 Acoustic tracks have lower popularity than energetic electronic tracks

🧰 Technologies Used
Category	Tools
Programming	Python 3.x
Libraries	Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Notebook	Jupyter / Google Colab

🏁 Conclusion

This Spotify Data Analysis project demonstrates how Python can be used to extract insights from music datasets. Through EDA and visualization, patterns in trending music, artist impact, and audio feature relationships become clear. This project is ideal for beginners in Data Analytics and serves as a strong GitHub portfolio project.
